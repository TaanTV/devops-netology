Задача 3. Знакомство с каталогом модулей.
В каталоге модулей найдите официальный модуль от aws для создания ec2 инстансов.
Изучите как устроен модуль. Задумайтесь, будете ли в своем проекте использовать этот модуль или непосредственно ресурс aws_instance без помощи модуля?
В рамках предпоследнего задания был создан ec2 при помощи ресурса aws_instance. Создайте аналогичный инстанс при помощи найденного модуля.
В качестве результата задания приложите ссылку на созданный блок конфигураций.

## Ответ:
Учимся вставлять модуль:

main.tf конфиг
````
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

module "ec2_cluster" {
  source                 = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version                = "~> 2.0"

  name                   = "my-netology-claster"
  instance_count         = 2

  ami                    = "ami-ebd02392"

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take
exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
